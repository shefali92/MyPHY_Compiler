1) The type of an identifier is the type appearing while declaring the variable.

2) The type of TK_NUMBERS is 	INT.

3) Types of other datatypes:
 	The type of TK_MASS is MASS.
 	The type of TK_FORCE is FORCE.
 	The type of TK_LEN is LEN.
 	The type of TK_TIME is TIME.
 	The type of TK_POW is POW.
 	The type of TK_DISP is DISP.
 	The type of TK_WORK is WORK.
 	
4) Type of expression : The type of a simple expression (say E) of the form expression(say E1) <operator> Expression(say E2) is
 
    MASS, if one expression is MASS and the other is MASS/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    TIME, if one expression is MASS and the other is TIME/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    LEN, if one expression is MASS and the other is LEN/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    FORCE, if one expression is MASS and the other is FORCE/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    WORK, if one expression is MASS and the other is WORK/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    POW, if one expression is MASS and the other is POW/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
    DISP, if one expression is MASS and the other is DISP/INT and the operator is arithmetic operator.
         
5) There will be an ERROR, if the above rules do not derive the type of E appropriately.

6) The type of an identifier or an expression is computed using the symbol table.
